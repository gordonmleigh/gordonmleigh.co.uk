        Hi, I'm Gordon Leigh, a highly motivated and skilled software engineer with a masters degree in electrical and mechanical engineering.  I previously ran a software product development consultancy, delivering bespoke software for clients across several industries.  I don't limit myself to a single technology stackâ€”I use the right tools for the current job, and continually learn new things to keep my skills sharp.  I like work that stretches me mentally, lets me learn new things, and provides an opportunity for me to deliver a fantastic solution.
